      <p> I am currently a student at Turing School of Software and Design studying
        software development. Prior to that, I spent ten years teaching elementary school
        and prior to that I was an officer in the US Army. I enjoy solving problems and
        helping people and I hope to use my new software skills to develop products that
        allow me to do these things. When not trying to learn as much as I can as fast
        as I can, I enjoy baseball, college football, judo, board games, traveling, and
        spending time enjoying Colorado with my husband and two dogs Dallas and Karma.</p>
