      <p> I am currently a student at Turing School of Software and Design. I enjoy solving
        problems, learning, and helping people. I hope to use my new software skills to develop
        products that allow me to do these things. When not trying to learn as much
        as I can as fast as I can, I enjoy baseball, college football, judo,
        board games, traveling, and spending time enjoying Colorado with my husband
         and two dogs Dallas and Karma.</p>
        <h4>Education and Work Experience</h4>
        <p>I started my education with a B.A. in psychology from the University of Michigan
          where I attended school on a ROTC scholarship. Upon graduation I served four years in
          the US Army as a Military Police Officer in various posts and deployments around
          the world. After leaving the Army I went through an alternative licensure program
          through Mesa State College to earn my elementary teaching license. I then spent
          ten years teaching elementary school in an urban district outside of Denver while
          earning my Masters in Reading Curriculum Development and Instruction.</p>
