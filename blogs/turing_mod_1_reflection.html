      <h4>Turing School Module 1 Reflections</h4>
      <h5>August 8, 2017</h5>
      <p>Six weeks ago I entered Turing with no more than a few months of beginner
      tutorials on all things tech related under my belt. I was scared to do anything
      on the command line because I thought I would break my computer. I figured that
      everyone else would have a lot more experience than me and that I would have to
      work twice as hard to catch up. Now, after only six weeks, I can say that
      these things either were not true, or are no longer true. I am comfortable
      working from the command line and using text editors. I can find answers to my
      tech issues, even if I don't completely understand them. I have learned how to
      use keyboard shortcuts so that I don't have to rely on a mouse anymore; a key skill
      to have as a developer. I have learned more about myself and how I approach and
      solve problems through pair programming with classmates. I also have a basic understanding
      of the ruby programming language and have used it to solve several complicated
      problems in a relatively short amount of time. You can find the code to all of the projects
      I have completed <a href="https://github.com/blsrofe">here</a>, but here
      is an overview of some of the projects I worked on during the last six weeks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="list">Week 3: Complete Me:</span> This was an autocomplete dictionary like you might find when trying to send
        a text message on your phone. We had to load a file of words and then suggest words based off of fragment
        that were typed in.</li>
        <li><span class = "list">Week 4: Battleship:</span> Remember battleship when you were a kid? I basically made a simple video game of
        it that you would play against a computer player.</li>
        <li><span class="list">Week 5-6: Black Thursday:</span> We used historical Etsy data and created an Object Relational Map(ORM) that allowed
        data to be loaded and parsed so that it could be analyzed for both merchants and customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But perhaps the most important thing I learned in my first
      six weeks is that it is OK to struggle and that more learning happens when you
      are forced to struggle. And believe me, there is no lack of struggle at Turing. To
      illustrate this point I want to talk about my week 2 project called Date Night, which
      is probably the project I struggled the most with. I had to pretend I was a developer
      at Netflix and make a data structure called a binary search tree that would let users
      input movie titles and score them. Based off the their scores, the program would
      recommend movies they should watch. Yep, that was the project I got after 1 week of
      instruction. Welcome to my struggle. I understood how binary search trees worked on
      paper, but I had no idea how to make it work with my limited ruby knowledge. Basically
      a binary search tree makes searching faster because everytime you put it a score,
      it just starts at the top of the tree and if the score is less than the top node it
      goes left, and if it is greater it goes right. It keeps doing this until it finds where
      your score fits. Essentially, you are eliminating half of the choices every time you move
      a step down the tree. I got the assignment on Thursday and by Saturday night I was near
      tears I was so frustrated. There were so many requirements that the program had to meet
      and I only had four more days to complete it. I couldn't do any of it, and not for lack of
      effort. Another thing that Turing pushes you towards is asking others for help. I went in to
      the school on Sunday morning hoping to find someone to help me. I found a former graduate
      of the program that was working remotely and offered to help me and a bunch of my
      classmates. We were all struggling and panicing. By that night, I had a decent idea of
      how to move forward and it centered around this magic called recursion. </p>
      <h5>Recursion</h5>
      <p>recursion stuff here</p>
      <p>I did not understand recursion the first time it was explained to me, or the second, or
      the third. However, there was a point early on Tuesday morning where I woke up and it it kind
      of made sense. I never did completely finish the project by the deadline. I was one step away.
      However, I was so happy that I understood recursion, or thought I did (during the next project I
      found out that I didn't understand it nearly as well as I though I did at the time), that I didn't
      really care. Had I not struggled with this concept for so long, I don't think I would have felt that way. Having
      struggled with it for so long really helped me to understand the concept better. Every project
      presented me with a lot of struggle, which led to a lot of learning, more so than if it would
      have just been taught in a lecture. I know there is a lot more struggle to come, which is great,
      because that means there is a lot more learning to come as well.
