      <h4>Turing School Module 1 Reflections</h4>
      <h5>August 8, 2017</h5>
      <p>Six weeks ago I entered Turing with no more than a few months of beginner
      tutorials on all things tech related under my belt. I was scared to do anything
      on the command line because I thought I would break my computer. I figured that
      everyone else would have a lot more experience than me and that I would have to
      work twice as hard to catch up.</p>
